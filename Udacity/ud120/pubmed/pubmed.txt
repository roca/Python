Simply, fever manifested with elevation of body temperature from normal physiological range represents adaptive response of immune system on challenge with an infectious and non-infectious circumstance. Fever usually initiated in the periphery as a result of interaction of immune cells with exogenous or endogenous pyrogens. Peripheral pyrogenic signals gain access to the central nervous system via humoral and neural route. Humoral pathway was initiated with production of pyrogenic cytokines and prostaglandins from immune cells of blood as well as liver, transmitted directly to pre-optic area of hypothalamus through the circumventricular organ of brain. On the other hand an alternative pathway was initiated by the same cytokines indirectly via stimulating the vagal sensory neurons result in pyrogenic fever; so-called neuronal pathway. If the magnitude of pyrogens associated fever is very high, it will lead to severe illness ranging from septic shock to death. So it is necessary to evaluate the presence of pyrogens in implants, medical devices, drugs and biological materials to ensure safety in biomedical applications and therapeutics. Classification, route of administration, mechanism of action and detection of pyrogens and associated products are the major subject of this review.']

However, the role of fever in the immunogenicity of measles-containing vaccines (MCV) is unclear. We performed a post-hoc pooled analysis of data of 5 216 11 to 22 month-old children receiving MCV from 2004 to 2012 in Europe and USA to evaluate the association between post-immunisation fever and antibody response, measured by geometric mean concentrations (GMCs). We further evaluated fever as an effect modifier or a mediator in the associations between the type of MCV or the age at first vaccination and vaccine immunogenicity. After the first dose, fever was associated with 60% higher GMCs (95% CI 1.51-1.68). For children vaccinated at \u2a7e12 months, the fever did not modify and minimally mediated (2% to 3%) the association between age and antibody response. Fever mediated 18% of the association between type of MCV and GMCs. In a model including fever, age and type of vaccine, fever was the strongest predictor of GMCs. These results suggest that fever is associated with a stronger measles antibody response independently of age and type of MCV.']

Abastract-12) [u'A fever, or increased body temperature, is a symptom of inflammation, which is a complex defence reaction of the organism to pathogenic infections. After pathogens enter the body, immune cells secrete a number of agents, the functions of which stimulate the body to develop a functional immune and fever response. In mammals it is known that PGE<sub>2</sub> is the principal mediator of fever. The extent to which PGE<sub>2</sub> and other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, or IL-1\u03b2 could be involved in the induction of behavioural fever in fish remains to be clarified. Several members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels have been implicated as transducers of thermal stimuli, including TRPV1 and TRPV2, which are activated by heat. Here we show that members of the TRP family, TRPV1 and TRPV4, may participate in the coordination of temperature sensing during the behavioural fever. To examine the behavioral fever mechanism in Salmo salar an infection with IPNV, infectious pancreatic necrosis virus, was carried out by an immersion challenge with 10\u202f\xd7\u202f10<sup>5</sup> PFU/mL<sup>-1</sup> of IPNV. Behavioural fever impacted upon the expression levels of both TRPV1 and TRPV4 mRNAs after the viral challenge and revealed a juxtaposed regulation of TRPV channels. Our results suggest that an increase in the mRNA abundance of TRPV1 is tightly correlated with a significant elevation in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and PGE<sub>2</sub>) in the Pre-Optic Area (POA) and cytokine release in plasma. Together, these data indicate that the reduction of TRPV4 expression during behavioural fever may contribute to the onset of behavioural fever influencing movement toward higher water temperatures. Our data also suggest an effect of TRPV channels in the regulation of behavioural fever through activation of EP3 receptors in the central nervous system by PGE<sub>2</sub> induced by plasma-borne cytokines. These results highlight for first time in mobile ectotherms the key role of pro-inflammatory cytokines and TRPV channels in behavioural fever that likely involves a complex integration of prostaglandin induction, cytokine recognition and temperature sensing.']

Abastract-14) [u'The most important risk factor for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is considered young age due to the immature immune system. The risk at young age is reported greater for RSV than for other respiratory infectious agents. Based on the strong association between young age and severity of RSV infection due to immature immunity, we aimed to assess whether there were any age-related differences in fever responses, as one clinical aspect of the immune response. In our observational study over two seasons (2014-2015 and 2015-2016), daily body temperatures of children under 3 years old with RSV infection were recorded from the first medical visit during the acute phase to defervescence. The body temperature records were analyzed among 171 children of four age groups (< 6, < 12, < 24 and \u2265 24 months), in terms of fever development, degrees of fever onset, the highest fever during the period, and fever duration. There were 54 patients in the group of < 6 months, 41 in the group of < 12 months, 58 in the group of < 24 months, and 18 in the group of \u2265 24 months. We thus found the correlation between age and fever responses under 24 months old; namely, the more the age advanced, the more frequently high and prolonged fever was experienced. Importantly, infants under 6 months old tend to show the suppressed fever responses. In conclusion, young infants with reduced fever response during RSV infection do not implicate less severity and needs attentive management.']

How does the metabolic response to bacterial products under ecologically relevant but unfavorable thermal field conditions compare to that measured in fever thermal preferendum?

Abastract-18) [u'Objective In Japan, pleurodesis is often performed using OK-432. However, OK-432 may cause severe chest pain and fever. The risk factors for these complications are unclear. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for chest pain and fever caused by pleurodesis with OK-432. Methods The clinical data of 94 patients who underwent pleurodesis with OK-432 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients who developed chest pain (indicated by a record of rescue pain medication) and/or fever (a recorded temperature of >38\xb0C) were identified. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the risk factors for these complications. Results Rescue medication for chest pain was required by 43.6% of the patients and 40.4% developed pyrexia after pleurodesis with OK-432. The univariate analysis showed that the likelihood of requiring rescue medication for chest pain was significantly increased in patients of <70 years of age (p=0.028) and in those who were not premedicated with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID; p=0.003). Age <70 years (adjusted odds ratio 2.97, 95% confidence interval 1.10-8.00, p=0.031) and a lack of premedication with an NSAID (adjusted odds ratio 4.21, 95% confidence interval 1.47-12.04, p=0.007) remained significant factors in a multivariate analysis. The absence of NSAID premedication was the only statistically significant risk factor for fever in the univariate analysis (p=0.034). The multivariate analysis revealed no significant risk factors for fever. Conclusion The results of the present study suggest that premedication with an NSAID might be useful for preventing the chest pain caused by pleurodesis with OK-432. Furthermore, caution is advised when managing chest pain in adults of <70 years of age. Prospective studies should be performed to further investigate this issue.']
Abastract-19) ['Fever and abdominal pain are common symptoms and could be main manifestations in patients with autoinflammatory diseases. A 48-year-old female patient was admitted with recurrent fever and abdominal pain for 9 years. Serum level of inflammatory markers synchronously fluctuated with fever, and returned to normal when fever subsided. The periodic episodes of fever occurred every 1 to 4 months and failed to respond to empirical antibiotics. Whole exome sequencing showed heterozygous mutation of NOD2 gene q902k, leading to the final diagnosis of autoinflammatory disease. Corticosteroid and tripterygiumglycosides were effective for the disease remission.']
